"""Generic ingestion pipeline.

Extracted from ``ingest_policy`` / ``_do_ingest`` in
``backend/app/rag/ingest.py`` (ragkit plan 04). The
pipeline orchestrates: load source, hash content, compare
the ingestion snapshot, retire the old version, chunk,
embed, validate, and upsert -- all inside one transaction
serialized by a PostgreSQL advisory lock.

Version *storage* is application-side: the pipeline talks
to a :class:`VersionStore` protocol, which the host
application implements against its version tables.
