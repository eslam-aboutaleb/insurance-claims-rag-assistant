"""Ingestion snapshot comparison.

Extracted from ``_do_ingest`` in
``backend/app/rag/ingest.py`` (ragkit plan 04).
The snapshot captures everything that determines
whether a stored index is still current: the source
hash, the embedding model and dimension, and the
chunker version and tunables. Comparing the current
snapshot against the stored one makes ingestion
idempotent -- an unchanged source is skipped instead
of re-embedded and re-upserted.

Version *storage* is application-side (plan 06 owns
it); this module defines the value type and the
comparison only.
