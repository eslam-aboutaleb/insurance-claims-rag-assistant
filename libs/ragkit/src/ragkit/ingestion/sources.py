"""Document source abstractions for ingestion.

Extracted from the file-reading half of
``ingest_policy`` in ``backend/app/rag/ingest.py``
(ragkit plan 04). A :class:`DocumentSource` loads
:class:`RawDocument` objects; the ingestion pipeline
hashes their content, chunks it, and embeds it.

Sources are the extension point for backends ragkit
does not ship (S3, databases, APIs): implement the
protocol and pass the source to
:meth:`ragkit.ingestion.pipeline.IngestionPipeline.run`.
