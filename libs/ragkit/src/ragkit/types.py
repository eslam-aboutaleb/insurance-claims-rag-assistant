"""Shared value types for ragkit.

Dataclasses are the canonical boundary across chunking, embedding,
storage, and retrieval. They replace the raw ``dict[str, Any]``
plumbing used by earlier iterations; the dict-based store API keeps
working during the transition, and later plans adapt it to these
types.
