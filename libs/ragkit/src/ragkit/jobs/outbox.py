"""Generic embedding-job outbox.

Generalized from ``backend/app/rag/embedding_jobs.py``
(ragkit extraction plan 05), away from the OmniCare
``Claim``/``EmbeddingJob`` model. The outbox pattern
decouples row insertion from embedding generation: a
job row is written in the same transaction as the row
it refers to, and a background worker claims pending
jobs, processes them, and records the outcome.

The job table itself is owned by the host
application: :class:`EmbeddingJobStore` is a
:class:`~typing.Protocol` implemented against any job
table, and :class:`JobProcessor` describes the work
done per job (embedding and upserting, in OmniCare's
case — that processor lives in the host application).

Outbox invariant
----------------
A job row must be committed in the **same transaction**
as the row it refers to. ``enqueue_job(store, payload,
session=...)`` therefore only flushes when a caller
session is supplied; without a session the store opens
its own transaction and commits.
