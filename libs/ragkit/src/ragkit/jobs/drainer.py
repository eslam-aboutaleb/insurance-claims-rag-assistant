"""Generic outbox drainer.

Moved from ``backend/app/workers/embedding_drain.py``
(ragkit extraction plan 05). Runs as its own process so
job processing never blocks an API request: the API
writes a job row in the same transaction as the row it
refers to; this worker claims pending jobs with
``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``, processes them, and marks
them ``completed``.

The drainer is parameterized by an
:class:`~ragkit.jobs.outbox.EmbeddingJobStore` and a
:class:`~ragkit.jobs.outbox.JobProcessor`, so it works
against any job table. Multiple drainers can run
concurrently: ``SKIP LOCKED`` keeps two workers from
processing the same job, so this scales horizontally
without coordination.
