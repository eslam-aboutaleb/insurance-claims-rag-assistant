"""Generic job outbox and drainer.

The outbox pattern decouples row insertion from
background processing: job rows are written in the
same transaction as the row they refer to, and a
drainer worker claims pending jobs with
``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``, processes them, and
records the outcome with retry/backoff/dead-letter
semantics.
