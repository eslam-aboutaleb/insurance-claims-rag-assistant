"""Embedding dimension registry.

Moved from ``backend/app/rag/embedding_dimensions.py`` (ragkit
plan 02). Single source of truth mapping embedding model names to
their vector dimensions, so changing the embedding model cannot
silently desynchronize the dimension checks at insert time.

The built-in table covers the models ragkit knows about;
:func:`register_dimension` is the public extensibility seam for
models the table does not know (host applications register their
provider's dimension at start-up).
