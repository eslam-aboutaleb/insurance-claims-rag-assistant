"""Answer quality evaluation for RAG systems.

Moved from ``backend/app/rag/answer_evaluator.py`` (ragkit
extraction plan 05). Provides two evaluation strategies:

1. **LLM-as-Judge**: uses a configured LLM (via LiteLLM) to
   score answer quality on multiple dimensions (faithfulness,
   relevance, completeness, conciseness).
2. **Heuristic scoring**: fast, deterministic keyword/overlap
   scoring that works offline without LLM API calls.

Both strategies produce standardized ``AnswerScore`` results
that can be aggregated across the full evaluation dataset.
The LLM judge reads its model from a :class:`RagSettings`
passed in by the caller — ragkit never imports the host
application's config module.

You are an expert evaluator for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
Your task is to evaluate the quality of a generated answer.

## Evaluation Criteria

Score each dimension from 0.0 to 1.0:

1. **Faithfulness** (0-1): Is the answer factually grounded in the retrieved context?
   Does it avoid hallucinating information not present in the context?
   - 1.0 = Fully faithful, all claims supported by context
   - 0.0 = Completely hallucinated or contradicts context

2. **Relevance** (0-1): Does the answer directly address the user's question?
   - 1.0 = Directly and precisely answers the question
   - 0.0 = Completely irrelevant

3. **Completeness** (0-1): Does the answer cover all key points from the gold answer?
   - 1.0 = Covers all key information
   - 0.0 = Misses all key information

4. **Conciseness** (0-1): Is the answer appropriately concise without unnecessary verbosity?
   - 1.0 = Perfectly concise
   - 0.0 = Extremely verbose or padded

## Input

**User Question:** {query}

**Retrieved Context:**
{context}

**Generated Answer:** {answer}

**Gold/Reference Answer:** {gold_answer}

## Output Format

Respond with ONLY a JSON object (no markdown, no extra text):

  "conciseness": <float>,
  "reasoning": "<brief explanation>"
