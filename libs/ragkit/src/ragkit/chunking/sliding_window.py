"""Sliding-window chunking.

Moved from ``backend/app/rag/ingest.py`` (ragkit plan 02).
Splits text into overlapping chunks based on word count: each
chunk holds ``chunk_size`` words and consecutive chunks overlap
by ``overlap`` words, so context is preserved across chunk
boundaries.

    """Split text into overlapping chunks based on word count.

    Uses a sliding window approach where each chunk contains ``chunk_size``
    words and subsequent chunks overlap by ``overlap`` words. This preserves
    context across chunk boundaries, which improves retrieval quality for
    queries that span section boundaries.

    Args:
        text: The input text to split into chunks.
        chunk_size: Maximum number of words per chunk. Defaults to 600.
        overlap: Number of words to overlap between consecutive chunks.
            Defaults to 100. Must satisfy ``0 <= overlap < chunk_size``.

    Returns:
        list[str]: A list of text chunks. Returns an empty list if the input
        text is empty or contains no words.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``chunk_size`` is not positive or ``overlap`` is
            outside ``[0, chunk_size)``.
