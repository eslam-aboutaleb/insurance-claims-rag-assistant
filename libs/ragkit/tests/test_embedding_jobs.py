"""
Tests for the ragkit job outbox engine.

Moved from ``backend/tests/test_embedding_jobs.py``
(ragkit extraction plan 05). The retry/backoff/
dead-letter engine now lives in ragkit and is
driven here through a fake in-memory
:class:`~ragkit.jobs.outbox.EmbeddingJobStore`
and :class:`~ragkit.jobs.outbox.JobProcessor` —
no OmniCare dependency. The OmniCare adapter's
database behavior is covered by the backend suite.
